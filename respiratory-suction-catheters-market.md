<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Suction Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-lumen</li><li>Double-lumen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Respiratory Suction Catheters market is segmented into single-lumen and double-lumen types. Single-lumen catheters feature a single channel for suctioning, making them simple and effective for clearing secretions. In contrast, double-lumen catheters have two channels: one for suctioning and another to deliver saline or oxygen, allowing for more complex procedures. While single-lumen catheters are widely used for routine suctioning, double-lumen versions are preferred in situations requiring simultaneous irrigation or medication delivery during the suctioning process.</p></p>
