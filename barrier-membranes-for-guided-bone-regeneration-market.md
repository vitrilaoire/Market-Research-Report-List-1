<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes for guided bone regeneration are critical in dental and orthopedic procedures to promote bone healing. Absorbable membranes, typically made from materials like collagen or polylactic acid, gradually dissolve, eliminating the need for surgical removal and allowing for natural tissue integration. Non-absorbable membranes, made from materials such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), provide long-term support but require a second surgery for removal. Together, they enable effective regeneration by preventing soft tissue infiltration into the bone defect area.</p></p>
