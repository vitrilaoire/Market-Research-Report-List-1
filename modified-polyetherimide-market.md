<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modified Polyetherimide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Melt Polycondensation</li><li>Solution Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modified polyetherimide market encompasses two primary types of production methods: melt polycondensation and solution polymerization. Melt polycondensation involves the direct reaction of monomers at high temperatures, allowing for the formation of polyetherimide in a solid form. This process is efficient and often results in high molecular weight polymers. In contrast, solution polymerization occurs in a solvent environment, enabling better control over molecular weight and distribution. This method is advantageous for producing high-purity polyetherimide suitable for specialized applications.</p></p>
